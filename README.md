# NLP Text Classification with Quantum Machine Learning (~ Quantum NLP) 

This project implements Natural Language Processing (NLP) text classification using both classical machine learning (ML) and quantum machine learning (QML) techniques. The goal is to demonstrate a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of classical and quantum models for better performance.

## Introduction

NLP is a subfield of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human languages. This project uses a dataset from the 20 Newsgroups to classify text into categories using both classical and quantum models. 

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development and testing.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-nlp.git
   cd quantum-nlp
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash

Copy
conda create -n quantum-nlp-env python=3.8
conda activate quantum-nlp-env
Install the required libraries:
bash

Copy
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn qiskit
